# smartHomeApplianceControl

This is a smart home appliance control solution. You can create various home appliances (such as a light, fan, or air conditioner) and a smart home appliance controller that you can use to manage the appliances.

Properties of appliances:

1. Light: The light can be turned on or off.

2. Fan: The fan can have 3 speeds. 0 = off, 1 = medium speed, and 2 = maximum speed.

3. Air Conditioner: The air conditioner can be turned off by setting the thermostat to the "off" mode. Other modes include "heat" and "cool".

If a smart home appliance controller is created, it will automatically turn off all appliances added to it on January 1st 1:00 AM local time for a system update.
